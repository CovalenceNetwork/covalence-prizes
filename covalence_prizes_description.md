### Summary of the Covalence Prizes Project

**Covalence Prizes** is a decentralized platform for creating, managing, and distributing prizes using homomorphic smart contracts (Solidity fhEVM). It aims to enhance privacy, participative social choice, and transparency in prize management, allowing for various prize allocation mechanisms and ensuring immutable records of prize details, submissions, and evaluations. The platform supports both monetary and non-monetary rewards, providing a secure and efficient way to incentivize innovation globally.

**Key Features:**

- **Decentralized Prize Management:** Prize creation, criteria selection, and evaluation involve community participation.
- **Privacy and Transparency:** Homomorphic smart contracts ensure privacy while maintaining verifiable and transparent records.
- **Flexible Reward Mechanisms:** Supports both monetary and non-monetary rewards.
- **Web Interface:** Accessible to organizers, evaluators, participants, and the public.

**Roles and User Journeys:**

- **Organizers:** Create prizes, define evaluation criteria, elect evaluators and contestants, manage prize lifecycle.
- **Evaluators:** Vote on criteria, evaluate contributions based on predefined dimensions, assign scores.
- **Participants:** View prize details, submit contributions, and monitor their submissions.
- **Public:** View prize details, contributions, and winners.

**System Components:**

- **PrizeManager Contract:** Manages admin activities, prize creation, and prize retrieval.
- **PrizeContract:** Handles criteria definition, submission storage, prize lifecycle management, evaluator registration, and reward allocation.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Develop smart contracts and tests.
2. Introduce a minimal web app.
3. Integrate Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

**Use Cases:**

- **Unconference Prizes:** Award sessions from events like the Virtual AI Safety Unconference.
- **Carbon Ecosystem Prizes:** Incentivize innovation in areas like the Carbon Black Supply Chain.

**Success Metrics:**

- Number of prizes created and completed.
- Total value of prizes distributed.
- Number of participants and submissions.
- Engagement and satisfaction of stakeholders.

**Strategic Considerations in Prize Design:**

- Incentive compatibility, individual rationality, efficiency, and fairness are crucial.
- Prizes should maximize total value, encourage participation, and ensure transparency and accountability.

**Challenges and Extensions:**

- Overinvestment, risk concentration, misaligned objectives, and lack of collaboration incentives are potential issues.
- Future extensions include reputation systems, formal verification, and zero-knowledge proofs.

**Contribution and Collaboration:**

- Developers can contribute through the Covalence Prizes GitHub repository.
- Non-technical contributions include creating content, gathering user feedback, and spreading awareness.

By leveraging decentralized technology and homomorphic encryption, Covalence Prizes aims to create a trustworthy and efficient platform for incentivizing innovation across various fields and industries.
